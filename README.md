Yo, Stixxy here! I'm a game developer so I'll mainly be posting game ideas or finished projects.
I'm interested in videogames, anime, coding, and (obviously) developing games!
I'm mainly here to have a good time and share my progress, so anyone is free to join me!
I'll probably change this later, but yeah, that's me.
